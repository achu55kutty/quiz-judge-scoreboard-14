/**
 * Implementation notes for real Judge0 API integration:
 * 
 * 1. Judge0 API requires setting up proper authentication
 * 2. The typical flow is:
 *    a. Create a submission with source code and language ID
 *    b. Poll for the submission status until it's processed
 *    c. Get the results (stdout, stderr, compile output, etc.)
 * 3. You'll need to handle rate limiting and token management
 * 4. For multiple test cases, you would need to create multiple submissions
 *    or use a custom approach to run all tests in one submission
 * 
 * Example real API endpoint: https://judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com/submissions
